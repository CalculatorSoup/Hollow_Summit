# 1.0.0
- Added an artifact teleporter to Hollow Summit and Frozen Summit, embedded into a cliff face (thanks to Viliger for providing the scripts used to add this!)
- Hollow Summit: Overhauled lighting. Now set during late dusk / early night with a dark crimson sky (was previously set during mid-day with an aqua / greenish sky)
- Hollow Summit: Removed some snow piles and replaced them with boulder clusters
- Hollow Summit: Fixed an egregious (barely noticeable) punctuation error in the logbook entry text
- The small cave at the top of the mountain is now more overgrown
- Added more foliage to the peninsula area connected to the lower teleporter dock
- Boulders inside caves no longer have grass/snow textures
- Tweaked materials for the silver and bronze ores
- Removed skybox stars and clouds
- Fixed a floating box
- Fixed a floating map node

# 0.1.2
- Attempted fix for floating interactables sometimes spawning in the cave (I have no idea why this suddenly started happening? It was related to the ceiling construct drill's node gates. disabling the drill's gameobjects in the unity editor seems to have fixed it. sorry again)

# 0.1.1
- Fixed the air tunnels' sound loops playing for the entire duration of the stage after passing through one (oops. sorry)
- The air tunnel that sometimes replaces the construct drill in the large cavern ceiling should now lift players slightly faster
- Disabled shadow casting for several objects in the cave (probably has close to zero impact on anything but hopefully you could get 0.1 more frames per second)

# 0.1.0
- Initial Release
