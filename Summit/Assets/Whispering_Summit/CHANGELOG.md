# 0.1.2
- Attempted fix for floating interactables sometimes spawning in the cave (I have no idea why this suddenly started happening? It was related to the ceiling construct drill's node gates. disabling the drill's gameobjects in the unity editor seems to have fixed it. sorry again)

# 0.1.1
- Fixed the air tunnels' sound loops playing for the entire duration of the stage after passing through one (oops. sorry)
- The air tunnel that sometimes replaces the construct drill in the large cavern ceiling should now lift players slightly faster
- Disabled shadow casting for several objects in the cave (probably has close to zero impact on anything but hopefully you could get 0.1 more frames per second)

# 0.1.0
- Initial Release
