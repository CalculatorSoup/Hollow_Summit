# Hollow Summit

An alternate Stage 5 environment set atop a snowcapped mountain that was hollowed out by an abandoned mining operation and is now being slowly corrupted by the moon looming above it.

The map has a unique layout that's probably closest to Helminth Hatchery, but if it was wider and shorter. The center of the map is a giant cavern with openings leading to slopes and cliffs that wrap around the mountain, leading to an upper layer near the peak. There are jump pads and air tunnels (like the ones in Repurposed Crater) scattered throughout the map to help with getting around.

# Variants

Hollow Summit also has two variants:
- Frozen Summit, a snowy variant with different enemies that replaces Hollow Summit after looping (by default; can be changed via config options)
- A Void replication of Hollow Summit with minimal edits, exclusive to SotV's Simulacrum gamemode
