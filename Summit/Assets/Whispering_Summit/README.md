# Hollow Summit

An alternate Stage 5 environment made in the style of vanilla maps, set atop a snowcapped mountain that was hollowed out by an abandoned mining operation. In recent times, it's become wracked with lunar corruption.

The map is structured sort of like Helminth Hatchery, where it's very tall and kind of gets narrower/more cramped near the top, but the lowest and tallest sections of the map are both in the center rather than on opposite sides. The center of the map is a giant cavern with openings leading to slopes and cliffs that wrap around the mountain, leading to an upper layer near the peak. There are jump pads and "air tunnels" (like the ones in Repurposed Crater) scattered everywhere to help with getting around.

# Variants

This mod also includes two variants of Hollow Crest:
- Frozen Summit, a snowy variant with different enemies that replaces Hollow Summit after looping (by default; can be changed via config options if you'd like)
- A Void replication of Hollow Summit with minimal edits, exclusive to SotV's Simulacrum gamemode

# Bugs / Issues

Please let me know on GitHub and/or Discord (@worms / @ry6240) if you encounter any issues with the map. Also feel free to message me if you have suggestions or other feedback!

**Known issues:**
- There is no artifact teleporter
  - Yeah sorry this is the second Stage 5 map I've uploaded without one. I tried to get it working again but it's just above my skill level I think. One day there will be an update where a working artifact teleporter is added and it will be cool
